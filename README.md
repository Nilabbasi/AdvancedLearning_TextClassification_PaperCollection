## Papers

### Learning Transferable Features in Meta-Learning for Few-Shot Text Classification
- **Authors**: Jincheng Xu, Qingfeng Du
- **Affiliation**: School of Software Engineering, Tongji University, Shanghai 200092, China
- **Publication Details**: Pattern Recognition Letters, Elsevier, Received 8 February 2019, Revised 4 October 2019, Accepted 4 May 2020, Available online 8 May 2020
- **Description:**: The paper introduces FSML (Few-Shot text classification in a Meta-Learning framework), a novel approach for addressing few-shot learning challenges in NLP. By leveraging the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) metric, FSML minimizes the distance between support and query distributions within each learning task, leading to improved generalization and accuracy gains in few-shot text classification tasks compared to the established MAML framework.
